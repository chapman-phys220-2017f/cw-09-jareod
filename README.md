# PHYS220 CW 9

**Author(s):** **Jarod Penniman, Jared Love**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2017f/cw-09-jareod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2017f/cw-09-jareod)

## Specification

This week, you will explore the differences between ```python/numpy``` and the established industry language ```MATLAB```. You will explore both the free clone Octave inside Jupyter, and native MATLAB on your lab computer (not inside CoCalc).

1. Open the notebook `cw09-examples.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
1. Use the following resources from the info respository to quickly assess the similarities between Python and MATLAB:
  * [Python vs. MATLAB](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)
  * [MATLAB-Python Dictionary](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html)
  * [MATLAB Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/)
  * [Learn Matlab in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/matlab/)
  * [MATLAB-Julia-Python-R Comparison](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_matrix_cheatsheet.html)
1. Note that if you like the MATLAB interface (interpreter, editor, variables-list all in one window), there exists a Python development environment that mimics it called [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). When developing in Python outside of CoCalc (such as after installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)), you can use the Spyder environment (or any other environment you choose).

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**This class work showed us that MATLAB is very similar to octave and is very useful.  It is good to know how to use these different programs that are used by a variety of different people in different fields.  **

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
